{"name":"Mapwriter-server","tagline":"A Java/Spring server for persisting MapWriter's markers between multiple users (useful for multiplayer servers !)","body":"### Welcome to MapWriter-Server.\r\nAs a team player for Minecraft and manager of two small Minecraft servers, I am always facing a classic problem: players who always have to write coordinates of interesting places to come back later. Problem which we fixed quite easily using @daveyliam 's MapWriter mod for Minecraft.\r\n\r\nBut -- yeah, you know there had to be a \"but\". Every player maintains his own places markers on his side. Good, but what happens when the player who has the coordinates we're interested in is away ? We're not able to go there. So the thing is, how to share markers ? Well, thanks to MapWriter being opensource, the answer is: Can I edit it enough to have it synchronize its markers (at least some of them) with a server application ?\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what MapWriter-Server aims to be: a server-side application which will receive or send marker information to the (modified) MapWriter mods of the players.\r\n\r\nTechnologically, it's a Spring Boot application. That's not a strategic choice; I worked a little bit woth Spring during my last internship and want to learn more about it !\r\n\r\n### Build\r\nMapWriter-Server packages as its own self-executable JAR, containing all its dependencies. In order to build the JAR file from the source code, use the `package` Maven goal.\r\n\r\n### Use\r\nMapWriter-Server is a JAR that you can simply start using the `java` command:\r\n`java -jar MapWriterServer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`\r\n\r\nThe server starts and outputs lots of lines. At the end, it will provide a \"Master Key\" you will then use to connect and perform administrative tasks with the MapWriter Admin Client:\r\n\r\n`2014-10-20 20:48:33.589  INFO 15420 --- [           main] n.b.minecraft.mapwriterserver.PostStart  : Master key is: **85b4f4d3-6c93-4e62-b6ff-1bda650f4c4e**`\r\n`2014-10-20 20:48:33.592  INFO 15420 --- [           main] n.b.m.mapwriterserver.Application        : Started Application in 39.255 seconds (JVM running for 42.04)`\r\n\r\nKeep this key, it will be useful to perform admin tasks.\r\nIf you forget it, just stop and start again MapWriter-Server: a new key will be generated. Please note that consequently, every restart of the application or of the server hardware will change the master key.\r\n\r\n### Admin tasks\r\nPlease refer to the [MapWriter-Admin-Client documentation](http://baviereteam.github.io/mapwriter-admin-client) to learn how to perform admin tasks.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
