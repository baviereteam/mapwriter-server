{"name":"Mapwriter-server","tagline":"A Java/Spring server for persisting MapWriter's markers between multiple users (useful for multiplayer servers !)","body":"### Welcome to MapWriter-Server.\r\nAs a team player for Minecraft and manager of two small Minecraft servers, I am always facing a classic problem: players who always have to write coordinates of interesting places to come back later. Problem which we fixed quite easily using @daveyliam 's MapWriter mod for Minecraft.\r\n\r\nBut -- yeah, you know there had to be a \"but\". Every player maintains his own places markers on his side. Good, but what happens when the player who has the coordinates we're interested in is away ? We're not able to go there. So the thing is, how to share markers ? Well, thanks to MapWriter being opensource, the answer is: Can I edit it enough to have it synchronize its markers (at least some of them) with a server application ?\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what MapWriter-Server aims to be: a server-side application which will receive or send marker information to the (modified) MapWriter mods of the players.\r\n\r\nTechnologically, it's a Spring Boot application. That's not a strategic choice; I worked a little bit woth Spring during my last internship and want to learn more about it !","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
