<p>As a team player for Minecraft and manager of two small Minecraft servers, I am always facing a classic problem: players who always have to write coordinates of interesting places to come back later. Problem which we fixed quite easily using <a href="https://github.com/daveyliam" class="user-mention">@daveyliam</a> 's MapWriter mod for Minecraft.</p>

<p>But -- yeah, you know there had to be a "but". Every player maintains his own places markers on his side. Good, but what happens when the player who has the coordinates we're interested in is away ? We're not able to go there. So the thing is, how to share markers ? Well, thanks to MapWriter being opensource, the answer is: Can I edit it enough to have it synchronize its markers (at least some of them) with a server application ?</p>

<p>This is exactly what MapWriter-Server aims to be: a server-side application which will receive or send marker information to the (modified) MapWriter mods of the players.</p>

<p>Technologically, it's a Spring Boot application. That's not a strategic choice; I worked a little bit woth Spring during my last internship and want to learn more about it !</p>
