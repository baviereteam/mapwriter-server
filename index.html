<a name="welcome-to-mapwriter-server" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-mapwriter-server"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to MapWriter-Server.</h3>

<p>As a team player for Minecraft and manager of two small Minecraft servers, I am always facing a classic problem: players who always have to write coordinates of interesting places to come back later. Problem which we fixed quite easily using <a href="https://github.com/daveyliam" class="user-mention">@daveyliam</a> 's MapWriter mod for Minecraft.</p>

<p>But -- yeah, you know there had to be a "but". Every player maintains his own places markers on his side. Good, but what happens when the player who has the coordinates we're interested in is away ? We're not able to go there. So the thing is, how to share markers ? Well, thanks to MapWriter being opensource, the answer is: Can I edit it enough to have it synchronize its markers (at least some of them) with a server application ?</p>

<p>This is exactly what MapWriter-Server aims to be: a server-side application which will receive or send marker information to the (modified) MapWriter mods of the players.</p>

<p>Technologically, it's a Spring Boot application. That's not a strategic choice; I worked a little bit woth Spring during my last internship and want to learn more about it !</p>

<h3>
<a name="build" class="anchor" href="#build"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Build</h3>

<p>MapWriter-Server packages as its own self-executable JAR, containing all its dependencies. In order to build the JAR file from the source code, use the <code>package</code> Maven goal.</p>

<h3>
<a name="use" class="anchor" href="#use"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use</h3>

<p>MapWriter-Server is a JAR that you can simply start using the <code>java</code> command:
<code>java -jar MapWriterServer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</code></p>

<p>The server starts and outputs lots of lines. At the end, it will provide a "Master Key" you will then use to connect and perform administrative tasks with the MapWriter Admin Client:</p>

<p><code>2014-10-20 20:48:33.589  INFO 15420 --- [           main] n.b.minecraft.mapwriterserver.PostStart  : Master key is: **85b4f4d3-6c93-4e62-b6ff-1bda650f4c4e**</code>
<code>2014-10-20 20:48:33.592  INFO 15420 --- [           main] n.b.m.mapwriterserver.Application        : Started Application in 39.255 seconds (JVM running for 42.04)</code></p>

<p>Keep this key, it will be useful to perform admin tasks.
If you forget it, just stop and start again MapWriter-Server: a new key will be generated. Please note that consequently, every restart of the application or of the server hardware will change the master key.</p>
